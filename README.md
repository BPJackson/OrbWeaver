App built in Ruby on Rails that generates a Spotify playlist containing the top songs of artists with shows in your city in the upcoming week, giving users the opportunity to get familiar and get tickets. Uses both the Bandsintown and Spotify API's.

It is recommended that you login via Facebook after the redirect, as there is currently a bug with the Spotify OAuth.
